# Working on Cybele Computers

There are 25 computers in Cybele (the lab previously known as Tulipan), all with powerful GPU cards (RTX 4090). There are a lot of students in the class and you have to consider your fellow students when you are using the GPU resources.

We ask you to follow this rule when using the computers:

- Each group can only use a single computer at a time.


## Environment
Every computer in the cybele lab comes with python2 and python3.
You can run code in python3 by using, `python3 my_program.py`.


### Installing packages
All the packages required to run the assignment is allready installed on the computers.
If you want to install additional packages in your environment, install it locally. For example:

```bash
pip3 install --user package_name
```

To get a list of already installed packages, use:
```
pip list
```

Pytorch is already installed on the computers and it should work out of the box with the GPU. Just launch python with "python3" in the terminal.
