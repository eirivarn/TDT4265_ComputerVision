    "When altering the number of nodes in a neural network, we can expect various effects on model performance. Generally, increasing the number of nodes can potentially enhance the model's capacity to learn complex patterns, leading to improved performance in terms of accuracy and reduced training loss. Conversely, decreasing the number of nodes may result in a simpler model that is less prone to overfitting but may sacrifice some accuracy. However, the exact impact on performance can vary depending on factors such as the complexity of the dataset, the architecture of the network, and the specific task at hand. "
